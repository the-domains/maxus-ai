At TechCrunch Disrupt New York 2016, Dag Kittlaus, CEO of Viv (and Siri co-founder) outlined the 4 requirements of the Intelligent Assistant / AI paradigm shift. 

Viv is betting on the "Single Agent" model: One assistant to rule them all. 

1\. One Assistant Forget app overload - imagine dealing with 50+ "vertical AI" assistants with a fragmented knowledge of the world. 

2\. Personalisation When is your partner's birthday? Do you prefer aisle or window seats? We want AI with a memory - your details, your needs, your preferences. 

3\. Available anywhere Single-agent AI needs impeccable cloud capability - available anywhere, on any device. Lose your phone? No problem: you should be able to access your version of Viv from a friend's device, or from your watch or car, to help you locate it. 

4\. Powerful ecosystem No one company can achieve the above - so Viv aims to connect to the largest third-party system of AIs and APIs.
